(A) Declare a variable named age and assign it the value 25.
*/

/*(B) Convert the age variable (from question 1) to a String and store it in a new variable named ageAsString.*/
    var ageAsString: String ="25"

     On question one I have declared a variable named age and assigned it the value 25,
     on question 1b I have converted the age variable to a string and stored it in a new variable named ageAsString

/* 2. Immutable vs. Mutable
Explain the difference between immutable and mutable variables in Kotlin.*/
/*Immutable variables are variables which cannot be changed while mutable variables
are variables that can be changed*/

/* 3. String Interpolation
Create a variable named name with your name as its value.
Then, create a new variable greeting that combines the name variable with a greeting message using string interpolation.
val name = "Faith"
val  greeting = "Hello"
val sentence = "$greeting my name is $name"
println(sentence)
}
In question 3 I have combined the name variable which I have assigned it the value Faith with the greeting message which I have assigned it to Hello
using the ($) sign

/*Function with Parameters
Write a function named sum that takes two parameters a and b (both integers) and returns their sum.
*/
/*fun main(){
  sum(24,76)
}
fun sum(num1: Int,num2:Int): Int {
    val a = 24
    var b = 12
    var sum = a + b
    println(sum)
    return sum
}
On question 4 I have declared a function named sum that is assigned to the parameters a and b and I have returned its sum

/*Default Parameter Value

Create a function named greet that takes a name parameter (String) and a greeting parameter (String with a default value of "Hello"). The function should return a formatted greeting message.*/
fun main(){
val greet = "Hello"
}
fun greet(name: String ):String{
    println(name)
}
In question 5 I have created a function named greet which takes in the name parameter that is a string and the
default value of the greeting parameter is Hello which returns a formatted greeting message.
